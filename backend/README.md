# Around the U.S. Back End  

This is the same Around the US project, however it now has a backend, which means that it's data is stored in the database in the dedicated server (probably).

##Technologies used:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Validator
- mongoose
- model schemas for a database

  
## Directories  
  
`/models` - Schemas for cards and users.
  
`/routes` — routing files.  

`/controllers` - handling files.

`/consts` - custom error messages.
  
All other directories are optional and may be created by the developer if necessary.   
  
## Running the Project  
  
`npm run start` — to launch the server.  
  
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.
